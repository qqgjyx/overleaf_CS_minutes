  abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is a multivariate technique that analyzes a data table in which observations are described by several inter-correlated quantitative dependent variables. Its goal is to extract the important information from the table, to represent it as a set of new orthogonal variables called principal components, and to display the pattern of similarity of the observations and of the variables as points in maps. The quality of the PCA model can be evaluated using cross-validation techniques such as the bootstrap and the jackknife. PCA can be generalized as correspondence analysis (CA) in order to handle qualitative variables and as multiple factor analysis (MFA) in order to handle heterogeneous sets of variables. Mathematically, PCA depends upon the eigen-decomposition of positive semi-definite matrices and upon the singular value decomposition (SVD) of rectangular matrices.

  abstract = {Multi-modal integration, which combines multiple neurophysiological signals, is gaining more attention for its potential to supplement single modality’s drawbacks and yield reliable results by extracting complementary features. In particular, integration of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is cost-effective and portable, and therefore is a fascinating approach to brain-computer interface (BCI). However, outcomes from the integration of these two modalities have yielded only modest improvement in BCI performance because of the lack of approaches to integrate the two different features. In addition, mismatch of recording locations may hinder further improvement. In this literature review, we surveyed studies of the integration of EEG/fNIRS in BCI thoroughly and discussed its current limitations. We also suggested future directions for efficient and successful multi-modal integration of EEG/fNIRS in BCI systems.},

In particular, we propose to fuse the capabilities of the support vector machine classifier and the fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm. While the former is used to generate a spectralbased classification map, the latter is adopted to provide an ensemble of clustering maps. To reduce the computation complexity, the most representative spectral channels identified by the Markov Fisher Selector algorithm are used during the clustering process. Then, these maps are successively labeled via a pairwise relabeling procedure with respect to the pixel-based classification map using voting rules. To generate the final classification result, we propose to aggregate the obtained set of spectro-spatial maps through different fusion methods based on voting rules and Markov Random Field theory. Experimental results obtained on two hyperspectral images acquired by the reflective optics system imaging spectrometer and the airborne visible/infrared imaging spectrometer, respectively; confirm the promising capabilities of the proposed framework.},

The proposed OpenSpyrit ecosystem responds to the need for reproducibility and benchmarking in single-pixel imaging by providing open data and open software. The SPIHIM collection, which is the first open-access FAIR dataset for hyperspectral single-pixel imaging, currently includes 140 raw measurements acquired using SPAS and the corresponding hypercubes reconstructed using SPYRIT. The hypercubes are reconstructed by both inverse Hadamard transformation of the raw data and using the denoised completion network (DC-Net), a data-driven reconstruction algorithm. The hypercubes obtained by inverse Hadamard transformation have a native size of 64 × 64 × 2048 for a spectral resolution of 2.3 nm and a spatial resolution that is comprised between 182.4 µm and 15.2 µm depending on the digital zoom. The hypercubes obtained using the DC-Net are reconstructed at an increased resolution of 128 × 128 × 2048. The OpenSpyrit ecosystem should constitute a reference to support benchmarking for future developments in single-pixel imaging.},

The hyperspectral band selection (HBS) task is considered as a clustering problem: bands are clustered in the image space; one representative image is then kept for each cluster, to be part of the set of selected bands. The proposed clustering method falls into the family of information-maximization clustering, where mutual information between data features and cluster assignments is maximized. Inspired by a clustering method of this family, we adapt it to the HBS problem and extend it to the case of multiple image features. A pixel selection step is also integrated to reduce the spatial support of the feature vectors, thus mitigating the curse of dimensionality. Experiments with different standard data sets show that the bands selected with our algorithm lead to higher classification performance, in comparison with other state-of-the-art HBS methods.},

This is done by using unsupervised fuzzy clustering methods. Here, two fuzzy clustering approaches have been addressed: Fuzzy C-Means clustering (FCM) and Fuzzy Relational Clustering (FRC). The proposed methods can also solve the problem of identifying the objects for which the radiance of light makes it barely hard to identify them as a single object e.g., a pitched roof. The proposed methods have been applied on the CASI image and the results show that they can successfully classify the materials in the image.},

Its medical applications are reviewed in this article, including tumor delimitation and identification, assessing tissue perfusion and its pathological conditions (including some complications like diabetic foot ulceration), making accurate surgical decisions, evaluating the health of dental structures, etc. Many of the articles show very promising results that required brief comments by the authors. It is clear that choosing the appropriate hyperspectral imaging system for each medical field, together with the most reliable hyperspectral image processing methods, are the main goals of future studies, before hyperspectral imaging becomes a widely applicable evaluation method in medicine. The authors try to answer some questions on this topic and set up some directions for future research.},

In particular, we assess performance of regularized radial basis function neural networks (Reg-RBFNN), standard support vector machines (SVMs), kernel Fisher discriminant (KFD) analysis, and regularized AdaBoost (Reg-AB). The novelty of this work consists in: 1) introducing Reg-RBFNN and Reg-AB for hyperspectral image classification; 2) comparing kernel-based methods by taking into account the peculiarities of hyperspectral images; and 3) clarifying their theoretical relationships. To these purposes, we focus on the accuracy of methods when working in noisy environments, high input dimension, and limited training sets. In addition, some other important issues are discussed, such as the sparsity of the solutions, the computational burden, and the capability of the methods to provide outputs that can be directly interpreted as probabilities.},

  abstract = {We address the problem of unsupervised clustering of multidimensional data when the number of clusters is not known a priori. The proposed iterative approach is a stochastic extension of the density-based clustering (KNNCLUST) method which randomly assigns objects to clusters by sampling a posterior class label distribution. In our approach, contextual class-conditional distributions are estimated based on a nearest neighbors graph, and are iteratively modified to account for current cluster labeling. Posterior probabilities are also slightly reinforced to accelerate convergence to a stationary labeling. A stopping criterion based on the measure of clustering entropy is defined thanks to the Kozachenko-Leonenko differential entropy estimator, computed from current class-conditional entropies. One major advantage of our approach relies in its ability to provide an estimate of the number of clusters present in the data set. The application of our approach to the clustering of real hyperspectral image data is considered. Our algorithm is compared with other unsupervised clustering approaches, namely affinity propagation (AP), KNNCLUST and Non Parametric Stochastic Expectation Maximization (NPSEM), and is shown to improve the correct classification rate in most experiments.},

The proposed approach employs several convolutional and pooling layers to extract deep features from HSIs, which are nonlinear, discriminant, and invariant. These features are useful for image classification and target detection. Furthermore, in order to address the common issue of imbalance between high dimensionality and limited availability of training samples for the classification of HSI, a few strategies such as L2 regularization and dropout are investigated to avoid overfitting in class data modeling. More importantly, we propose a 3-D CNN-based FE model with combined regularization to extract effective spectral–spatial features of hyperspectral imagery. Finally, in order to further improve the performance, a virtual sample enhanced method is proposed. The proposed approaches are carried out on three widely used hyperspectral data sets: Indian Pines, University of Pavia, and Kennedy Space Center. The obtained results reveal that the proposed models with sparse constraints provide competitive results to state-of-the-art methods. In addition, the proposed deep FE opens a new window for further research.},

  abstract = {Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a technique that can obtain more spectral information than that in normal color images. Due to this property and strength in material classification, it is widely used in remote sensing, agriculture, and environmental monitoring. In recent years, with the rapid developments of hardware, hyperspectral cameras have become more portable and a ordable. An increasing number of studies are being conducted on HSI systems, and research focuses have expanded from remote sensing to close-range objects. With a proper microscopic kit, a hyperspectral camera can capture images of objects of micrometers in size. In this thesis, an HSI system is introduced which consists of a hyperspectral camera, a microscope, control software, and an image processing workstation. The samples are placed under the microscope which has the camera mounted on the top. The parameters of the camera can be tuned by the control software to have the best image quality. After the setup, the camera takes the HSI image of the samples. Then, the image is transferred to the workstation and saved as a raw HSI image for further process. Two datasets of cells and microplastics are collected and introduced as benchmark datasets for this research. The reason to build these two benchmarks is because of their demands. In the area of cell viability assay, traditional methods use uorescent dyes to distinguish live and dead cells. Although working very reliably, they require physical contact with the cells, which a ects the appearance of the cells and some of the original cell features. As a consequence, there is a demand for the development of non-invasive technology for cell analysis. Our HSI system is capable of using computer vision techniques to classify live and dead cells as a non-invasive and systematic method so that the property of the cells can remain unchanged and the system can be operated without special skills. The microplastics dataset is built to address the needs of environmental protection which is an important research topic with significant social and economic values. The increasing amount of microplastics in the ocean has attracted enormous concern because of its potential to damage the ecosystem and a ect the health of humans and animals. While HSI has shown great potential in analyzing microplastics, studies in this direction are hindered by the lack of public available image data. Therefore, there is an urgent so that there is an urgent demand to build a dataset for microplastics detection. After the datasets have been constructed, we evaluate the support vector machine (SVM) on them for the baseline approach. We apply several feature extraction methods to process the HSI images of the cells before feeding them into the SVM, including extended morphology profile (EMP), tensor morphology profile (TMP), 3D scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT3D), 3D local derivative pattern (3DLDP) and spectral-spatial scaleinvariant feature transform (SS-SIFT). Among them, TMP has the best performance for the cell classification task. Regarding the detection of microplastics, the spectral signature is used to extract the feature and is fed into SVM for detection. Furthermore, we propose a novel attention-based convolutional neural networks (CNN) to classify the cells to take advantage of the development in deep learning. Inspired by the VGG networks, we first build a classification network for our hyperspectral data. Then, a band weighting network and a spatial weighting network are integrated into the backbone. The band weighting network assigns a weight to each band in the hyperspectral images. The weights can suppress redundant bands that do not make an important contribution to the classification task and make the classification network focus on the bands that have more important features for classification. The spatial weighting network assigns a weight to each pixel in the hyperspectral images. The weights can help the classification network focus on important parts of the images and ignore the irrelevant parts. These two weighting networks help to improve the final classification accuracy of the cells. In the experiments on hand-crafted features, SVM with TMP feature extraction method has the best accuracy of 83.72\% for the cell classification task. SVM with spectral signature produces 99.13\% accuracy on the microplastics detection task. In comparison, the attention-based CNN achieves 98.17\% for the cell classification task. These results show that our HSI system and classification methods have great potential for these two classification and detection tasks. The richness of spectral information that is provided by hyperspectral images has a great potential in material recognition tasks, helping to classify di erent materials based on their unique spectral signatures of each material. Because of this, our research can contribute to a wider range of biomedical and environmental domains.},

  abstract = {The use of hyperspectral imaging for medical applications is becoming more common in recent years. One of the main obstacles that researchers find when developing hyperspectral algorithms for medical applications is the lack of specific, publicly available, and hyperspectral medical data. The work described in this paper was developed within the framework of the European project HELICoiD (HypErspectraL Imaging Cancer Detection), which had as a main goal the application of hyperspectral imaging to the delineation of brain tumors in real-time during neurosurgical operations. In this paper, the methodology followed to generate the first hyperspectral database of in-vivo human brain tissues is presented. Data was acquired employing a customized hyperspectral acquisition system capable of capturing information in the Visual and Near InfraRed (VNIR) range from 400 to 1000 nm. Repeatability was assessed for the cases where two images of the same scene were captured consecutively. The analysis reveals that the system works more efficiently in the spectral range between 450 and 900 nm. A total of 36 hyperspectral images from 22 different patients were obtained. From these data, more than 300 000 spectral signatures were labeled employing a semi-automatic methodology based on the spectral angle mapper algorithm. Four different classes were defined: normal tissue, tumor tissue, blood vessel, and background elements. All the hyperspectral data has been made available in a public repository.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose—Although modern multisequence stroke MRI protocols are an emerging imaging routine for the diagnostic assessment of acute ischemic stroke, their sensitivity for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), the most important differential diagnosis, is still a matter of debate. We hypothesized that stroke MRI is accurate in the detection of ICH. To evaluate our hypotheses, we conducted a prospective multicenter trial. Methods—Stroke MRI protocols of 6 university hospitals were standardized. Images from 62 ICH patients and 62 nonhemorrhagic stroke patients, all imaged within the first 6 hours after symptom onset (mean, 3 hours 18 minutes), were analyzed. For diagnosis of hemorrhage, CT served as the “gold standard.” Three readers experienced in stroke imaging and 3 final-year medical students, unaware of clinical details, separately evaluated sets of diffusion-, T2-, and T2*-weighted images. The extent and phenomenology of the hemorrhage on MRI were assessed separately. Results—Mean patient age was 65.5 years; median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 10. The experienced readers identified ICH with 100\% sensitivity (confidence interval, 97.1 to 100) and 100\% overall accuracy. Mean ICH size was 17.3 mL (range, 1 to 101.5 mL). The students reached a mean sensitivity of 95.16\% (confidence interval, 90.32 to 98.39). Conclusions—Hyperacute ICH causes a characteristic imaging pattern on stroke MRI and is detectable with excellent accuracy. Even raters with limited film-reading experience reached good accuracy. Stroke MRI alone can rule out ICH and demonstrate the underlying pathology in hyperacute stroke. (Stroke. 2004;35:502-507.)},

Yet, it suffers from certain drawbacks and limitations when used for clustering highdimensional data. We introduce SD-DP, the sparse dual version of DP. While following the DP principle and maintaining its appealing properties, we find and use a sparse descriptor of local density as a robust representation. By analyzing and exploiting the consequential properties, we are able to use sparse graph-matrix expressions and operations throughout the clustering process. As a result, SD-DP has provably linear-scaling computation complexity under practical conditions. We show with experimental results on several real-world high-dimensional datasets, that SD-DP outperforms DP in robustness, accuracy, self-governess, and efficiency.},

However, the resulting high dimensionality in the feature space may render a classification task unreliable, mainly due to overfitting and the Hughes phenomenon. In order to attenuate such problems, one can resort to dimensionality reduction (DR). Thus, this paper proposes a new DR algorithm, which performs an unsupervised band selection technique following a clustering approach. More specifically, the data set was split into a predefined number of clusters, after which the bands were iteratively selected based on the parameters of a separating hyperplane, which provided the best separation in the feature space, in a one-versus-all scenario. Then, a fine-tuning of the initially selected bands took place based on the separability of clusters. A comparison with five other state-of-the-art frameworks shows that the proposed method achieved the best classification results in 60\% of the experiments.},

  abstract = {When clustering a dataset, the right number k of clusters to use is often not obvious, and choosing k automatically is a hard algorithmic problem. In this paper we present an improved algorithm for learning k while clustering. The G-means algorithm is based on a statistical test for the hypothesis that a subset of data follows a Gaussian distribution. G-means runs k-means with increasing k in a hierarchical fashion until the test accepts the hypothesis that the data assigned to each k-means center are Gaussian. Two key advantages are that the hypothesis test does not limit the covariance of the data and does not compute a full covariance matrix. Additionally, G-means only requires one intuitive parameter, the standard statistical significance level α. We present results from experiments showing that the algorithm works well, and better than a recent method based on the BIC penalty for model complexity. In these experiments, we show that the BIC is ineffective as a scoring function, since it does not penalize strongly enough the model’s complexity.},

  abstract = {A hybrid brain computer interface (BCI) system considered here is a combination of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). EEG-fNIRS signals are simultaneously recorded to achieve high motor imagery task classification. This integration helps to achieve better system performance, but at the cost of an increase in system complexity and computational time. In hybrid BCI studies, channel selection is recognized as the key element that directly affects the system’s performance. In this paper, we propose a novel channel selection approach using the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, where only highly correlated channels are selected from each hemisphere. Then, four different statistical features are extracted, and their different combinations are used for the classification through KNN and Tree classifiers. As far as we know, there is no report available that explored the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient for hybrid EEG-fNIRS BCI channel selection. The results demonstrate that our hybrid system significantly reduces computational burden while achieving a classification accuracy with high reliability comparable to the existing literature.},

  abstract = {Abstract—Classification is an important aspect of hyperspectral images processing and application. At present, the researchers mostly use the classic airborne hyperspectral imagery as the benchmark dataset. However, existing datasets suffer from three bottlenecks: (1) low spatial resolution; (2) low labeled pixels proportion; (3) low degree of subclasses distinction. In this paper, a new benchmark dataset named the Wuhan UAV-borne hyperspectral image (WHU-Hi) dataset was built for hyperspectral image classification. The WHU-Hi dataset with a high spectral resolution (nm level) and a very high spatial resolution (cm level), which we refer to here as H2 imager. Besides, the WHU-Hi dataset has a higher pixel labeling ratio and finer subclasses. Some start-of-art hyperspectral image classification methods benchmarked the WHU-Hi dataset, and the experimental results show that WHU-Hi is a challenging dataset. We hope WHU-Hi dataset can become a strong benchmark to accelerate future research.},

Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We have applied this approach to segmenting static images, as well as motion sequences, and found the results to be very encouraging.},

  abstract = {Recently, the integration of different electrophysiological signals into an electroencephalogram (EEG) has become an effective approach to improve the practicality of brain-computer interface (BCI) systems, referred to as hybrid BCIs. In this paper, a hybrid BCI was designed by combining an EEG with electrocardiograph (EOG) signals and tested using a target selection experiment. Gaze direction from the EOG and the event-related (de)synchronization (ERD/ERS) induced by motor imagery from the EEG were simultaneously detected as the output of the BCI system. The target selection mechanism was based on the synthesis of the gaze direction and ERD activity. When an ERD activity was detected, the target corresponding to the gaze direction was selected; without ERD activity, no target was selected, even when a subjects gaze was directed at the target. With this mechanism, the operation of the BCI system is more flexible and voluntary. The accuracy and completion time of the target selection tasks during the online testing were 89.3\% and 2.4 seconds, respectively. These results show the feasibility and practicality of this hybrid BCI system, which can potentially be used in the rehabilitation of disabled individuals.},

  abstract = {Hyperspectral imaging technology has evolved for over thirty years and is widely used for geologic mapping, environmental monitoring, vegetation analysis, atmospheric characterization, biological and chemical detection, etc. With advances in technology, hyperspectral imagery not only determines the presence of materials and objects, but more importantly, also quantifies the variability and abundance of the identified materials or objects. Airborne hyperspectral imagers still perform a vital role in remote sensing fields due to advantages of spatial resolution, performance capabilities in a cloudy atmosphere, and onboard maintenance as compared to similar imagers aboard spaceborne platforms. To date, hundreds of airborne hyperspectral systems have been designed, built, and operated. Here, a review of key technologies for airborne hyperspectral imaging technology during past three decades is presented. First discussed will be high throughput imaging modes, high quality spectroscopic subsystems, and high sensitivity detector technology used on current airborne hyperspectral imagers. Particularly, the importance of data-processing such as calibration, geometric rectification, and atmospheric correction are discussed. Next, several new and novel applications are presented on the basis of state-ofthe-art airborne hyperspectral technology. Finally, an outlook of challenges and future technology directions is presented along with general advice for designing and realizing novel high-performance airborne hyperspectral systems in this rapidly evolving field. By illustrating the status and prospects of typical airborne hyperspectral imagers, this overview provides a comparison of the technologies employed in previous hyperspectral imaging systems, current imaging technology research programs and prospects for innovative technology in future airborne hyperspectral imaging platforms.},

In recent years, the availability of new sensor designs, more powerful processors, and high-capacity storage further opened this imaging modality to a wider array of applications like medical diagnosis, agriculture, and cultural heritage. This necessitates new tools that allow general analysis of the image data and are intuitive to users who are new to hyperspectral imaging. We introduce a novel framework that bundles new interactive visualization techniques with powerful algorithms and is accessible through an efficient and intuitive graphical user interface. We visualize the spectral distribution of an image via parallel coordinates with a strong link to traditional visualization techniques, enabling new paradigms in hyperspectral image analysis that focus on interactive raw data exploration. We combine novel methods for supervised segmentation, global clustering, and nonlinear false-color coding to assist in the visual inspection. Our framework coined Gerbil is open source and highly modular, building on established methods and being easily extensible for application-specific needs. It satisfies the need for a general, consistent software framework that tightly integrates analysis algorithms with an intuitive, modern interface to the raw image data and algorithmic results. Gerbil finds its worldwide use in academia and industry alike with several thousand downloads originating from 45 countries.},

In this paper, we present a simple and efficient implementation of Lloyd's k-means clustering algorithm, which we call the filtering algorithm. This algorithm is easy to implement, requiring a kd-tree as the only major data structure. We establish the practical efficiency of the filtering algorithm in two ways. First, we present a data-sensitive analysis of the algorithm's running time, which shows that the algorithm runs faster as the separation between clusters increases. Second, we present a number of empirical studies both on synthetically generated data and on real data sets from applications in color quantization, data compression, and image segmentation.},

To be able to compare numerically different methods in the class, with different preconditioners, we propose a common system of model tests, using random preconditioners and initial guesses. As the “ideal” control algorithm, we advocate the standard preconditioned conjugate gradient method for finding an eigenvector as an element of the null-space of the corresponding homogeneous system of linear equations under the assumption that the eigenvalue is known. We recommend that every new preconditioned eigensolver be compared with this “ideal” algorithm on our model test problems in terms of the speed of convergence, costs of every iteration, and memory requirements. We provide such comparison for our LOBPCG method. Numerical results establish that our algorithm is practically as efficient as the “ideal” algorithm when the same preconditioner is used in both methods. We also show numerically that the LOBPCG method provides approximations to first eigenpairs of about the same quality as those by the much more expensive global optimization method on the same generalized block Krylov subspace. We propose a new version of block Davidson’s method as a generalization of the LOBPCG method. Finally, direct numerical comparisons with the Jacobi–Davidson method show that our method is more robust and converges almost two times faster.},

GA’s used earlier in clustering employ either an expensive crossover operator to generate valid child chromosomes from parent chromosomes or a costly fitness function or both. To circumvent these expensive operations, we hybridize GA with a classical gradient descent algorithm used in clustering viz., K-means algorithm. Hence, the name genetic K-means algorithm (GKA). We define K-means operator, one-step of K-means algorithm, and use it in GKA as a search operator instead of crossover. We also define a biased mutation operator specific to clustering called distance-based-mutation. Using finite Markov chain theory, we prove that the GKA converges to the global optimum. It is observed in the simulations that GKA converges to the best known optimum corresponding to the given data in concurrence with the convergence result. It is also observed that GKA searches faster than some of the other evolutionary algorithms used for clustering.},

  abstract = {Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) of tissue samples in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) range provides spectro-chemical and tissue structure information at subcellular spatial resolution. Disease states can be directly assessed by analyzing the mid-IR spectra of different cell types (e.g., epithelial cells) and sub-cellular components (e.g., nuclei), provided that we can accurately classify the pixels belonging to these components. The challenge is to extract information from hundreds of noisy mid-IR bands at each pixel, where each band is not very informative in itself, making annotations of unstained tissue HSI images particularly tricky. Because the tissue structure is not necessarily identical between the two sections, only a few regions in unstained HSI image can be annotated with high confidence, even when serial (or adjacent) hematoxylin and eosin stained section is used as a visual guide. In order to completely use both labeled and unlabeled pixels in training images, we have developed an HSI pixel classification method that uses semi-supervised learning for both spectral dimension reduction and hierarchical pixel clustering. Compared to the supervised classifiers, the proposed method was able to account for the vast differences in the spectra of sub-cellular components of the same cell type and to achieve an F1 score of 71.18\% on twofold cross-validation across 20 tissue images. To generate further interest in this promising modality, we have released our source code and also showed that disease classification is straightforward after HSI image segmentation.},

Unlike current state-of-the-art approaches in CNN-based hyperspectral image classification, the proposed network, called contextual deep CNN, can optimally explore local contextual interactions by jointly exploiting local spatio-spectral relationships of neighboring individual pixel vectors. The joint exploitation of the spatiospectral information is achieved by a multi-scale convolutional filter bank used as an initial component of the proposed CNN pipeline. The initial spatial and spectral feature maps obtained from the multi-scale filter bank are then combined together to form a joint spatio-spectral feature map. The joint feature map representing rich spectral and spatial properties of the hyperspectral image is then fed through a fully convolutional network that eventually predicts the corresponding label of each pixel vector. The proposed approach is tested on three benchmark data sets: the Indian Pines data set, the Salinas data set, and the University of Pavia data set. Performance comparison shows enhanced classification performance of the proposed approach over the current state-of-the-art on the three data sets.},

HSI data is typically presented in the format of 3D cubes. Thus, 3D spatial filtering naturally offers a simple and effective method for simultaneously extracting the spectral–spatial features within such images. In this paper, a 3D convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) framework is proposed for accurate HSI classification. The proposed method views the HSI cube data altogether without relying on any preprocessing or post-processing, extracting the deep spectral–spatial-combined features effectively. In addition, it requires fewer parameters than other deep learning-based methods. Thus, the model is lighter, less likely to over-fit, and easier to train. For comparison and validation, we test the proposed method along with three other deep learning-based HSI classification methods—namely, stacked autoencoder (SAE), deep brief network (DBN), and 2D-CNN-based methods—on three real-world HSI datasets captured by different sensors. Experimental results demonstrate that our 3D-CNN-based method outperforms these state-of-the-art methods and sets a new record.},

  abstract = {Recently, the field of hyperspectral image (HSI) classification is dominated by deep learning-based methods. However, training deep learning models usually needs a large number of labeled samples to optimize thousands of parameters. In this article, a deep multiview learning method is proposed to deal with the small sample problem of HSI. First, two views of an HSI scene are constructed by applying principal component analysis to different bands. Second, a deep residual network is designed to embed the different views of a sample to a latent space. The designed deep residual network is trained by maximizing agreement between differently augmented views of the same data sample via a contrastive loss in the latent space. Note that the training procedure of the designed deep residual network does not use labeled information. Therefore, the proposed method belongs to the category of unsupervised learning, which could alleviate the lack of labeled training samples. Finally, a conventional machine learning method (e.g., support vector machine) is used to complete the classification task in the learned latent space. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experiments are carried on four widely used hyperspectral data sets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method could improve the classification accuracy with small samples.},

  abstract = {Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) has been drastically applied in recent years to cultural heritage (CH) analysis, conservation, and also digital restoration. However, the efficient processing of the large datasets registered remains challenging and still in development. In this paper, we propose to use the hierarchical clustering algorithm (HCA) as an alternative machine learning approach to the most common practices, such as principal component analysis(PCA). HCA has shown its potential in the past decades for spectral data classification and segmentation in many other fields, maximizing the information to be extracted from the high-dimensional spectral dataset via the formation of the agglomerative hierarchical tree. However, to date, there has been very limited implementation of HCA in the field of cultural heritage. Data used in this experiment were acquired on real historic film samples with various degradation degrees, using a custom-made push-broom VNIR hyperspectral camera (380–780nm). With the proposed HCA workflow, multiple samples in the entire dataset were processed simultaneously and the degradation areas with distinctive characteristics were successfully segmented into clusters with various hierarchies. A range of algorithmic parameters was tested, including the grid sizes, metrics, and agglomeration methods, and the best combinations were proposed at the end. This novel application of the semi-automating and unsupervised HCA could provide a basis for future digital unfading, and show the potential to solve other CH problems such as pigment mapping.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing is a useful tool for monitoring spatio-temporal variations of crop morphological and physiological status and supporting practices in precision farming. In comparison with multispectral imaging, hyperspectral imaging is a more advanced technique that is capable of acquiring a detailed spectral response of target features. Due to limited accessibility outside of the scientific community, hyperspectral images have not been widely used in precision agriculture. In recent years, different mini-sized and low-cost airborne hyperspectral sensors (e.g., Headwall Micro-Hyperspec, Cubert UHD 185-Firefly) have been developed, and advanced spaceborne hyperspectral sensors have also been or will be launched (e.g., PRISMA, DESIS, EnMAP, HyspIRI). Hyperspectral imaging is becoming more widely available to agricultural applications. Meanwhile, the acquisition, processing, and analysis of hyperspectral imagery still remain a challenging research topic (e.g., large data volume, high data dimensionality, and complex information analysis). It is hence beneficial to conduct a thorough and in-depth review of the hyperspectral imaging technology (e.g., different platforms and sensors), methods available for processing and analyzing hyperspectral information, and recent advances of hyperspectral imaging in agricultural applications. Publications over the past 30 years in hyperspectral imaging technology and applications in agriculture were thus reviewed. The imaging platforms and sensors, together with analytic methods used in the literature, were discussed. Performances of hyperspectral imaging for different applications (e.g., crop biophysical and biochemical properties’ mapping, soil characteristics, and crop classification) were also evaluated. This review is intended to assist agricultural researchers and practitioners to better understand the strengths and limitations of hyperspectral imaging to agricultural applications and promote the adoption of this valuable technology. Recommendations for future hyperspectral imaging research for precision agriculture are also presented.},

  abstract = {In recent years, vector-based machine learning algorithms, such as random forests, support vector machines, and 1-D convolutional neural networks, have shown promising results in hyperspectral image classification. Such methodologies, nevertheless, can lead to information loss in representing hyperspectral pixels, which intrinsically have a sequence-based data structure. A recurrent neural network (RNN), an important branch of the deep learning family, is mainly designed to handle sequential data. Can sequence-based RNN be an effective method of hyperspectral image classification? In this paper, we propose a novel RNN model that can effectively analyze hyperspectral pixels as sequential data and then determine information categories via network reasoning. As far as we know, this is the first time that an RNN framework has been proposed for hyperspectral image classification. Specifically, our RNN makes use of a newly proposed activation function, parametric rectified tanh (PRetanh), for hyperspectral sequential data analysis instead of the popular tanh or rectified linear unit. The proposed activation function makes it possible to use fairly high learning rates without the risk of divergence during the training procedure. Moreover, a modified gated recurrent unit, which uses PRetanh for hidden representation, is adopted to construct the recurrent layer in our network to efficiently process hyperspectral data and reduce the total number of parameters. Experimental results on three airborne hyperspectral images suggest competitive performance in the proposed mode. In addition, the proposed network architecture opens a new window for future research, showcasing the huge potential of deep recurrent networks for hyperspectral data analysis.},

Markov diffusions are defined on the space of HSI spectra with transitions constrained to near spatial neighbors. The explicit incorporation of spatial regularity into the diffusion construction leads to smoother random processes that are more adapted for unsupervised machine learning than those based on spectra alone. The regularized diffusion process is subsequently used to embed the high-dimensional HSI into a lower-dimensional space through diffusion distances. Cluster modes are computed using kernel density estimation and diffusion distances, and all other points are labeled according to these modes. The proposed method has low computational complexity and performs competitively against state-of-the-art HSI clustering algorithms on real data. In particular, the proposed spatial regularization confers both theoretical and empirical advantages over nonregularized methods.},

  abstract = {The problem of unsupervised learning and segmentation of hyperspectral images is a significant challenge in remote sensing. The high dimensionality of hyperspectral data, presence of substantial noise, and overlap of classes all contribute to the difficulty of automatically clustering and segmenting hyperspectral images. In this article, we propose an unsupervised learning technique that combines a geometric estimation of class modes with a diffusion-inspired labeling that incorporates both spatial and spectral information. The mode estimation incorporates the geometry of the hyperspectral data by using diffusion distance to promote learning a unique mode from each class. These class modes are then used to label all points by a joint spatial-spectral nonlinear diffusion process. The proposed method, called spatial-spectral diffusion learning (DLSS), is shown to perform competitively against benchmark and state-ofthe-art hyperspectral clustering methods on a variety of synthetic and real datasets. The proposed methods are shown to enjoy low computational complexity and fast empirical runtime. Two variations of the proposed method are also discussed. The first variation combines the proposed method of mode estimation with partial least squares regression (PLSR) to efficiently segment chemical plumes in hyperspectral images for anomaly detection. The second variation incorporates active learning to allow the user to request labels for a very small number of pixels, which can dramatically improve overall clustering results. Extensive experimental analysis demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods, and their robustness to choices of parameters.},

However, training large-capacity learners to segment such imagery requires representative training sets. Acquiring such data is humandependent and time-consuming, especially in earth observation scenarios, where the hyperspectral data transfer is very costly and time-constrained. In this letter, we show how to effectively deal with a limited number and size of available hyperspectral groundtruth sets and apply transfer learning for building deep feature extractors. Also, we exploit spectral dimensionality reduction to make our technique applicable over hyperspectral data acquired using different sensors, which may capture different numbers of hyperspectral bands. The experiments, performed over several benchmarks and backed up with statistical tests, indicated that our approach allows us to effectively train well-generalizing deep convolutional neural nets even using significantly reduced data.},

Our algorithms all share two definitive features: first, they involve iterative removal of edges from the network to split it into communities, the edges removed being identified using any one of a number of possible “betweenness” measures, and second, these measures are, crucially, recalculated after each removal. We also propose a measure for the strength of the community structure found by our algorithms, which gives us an objective metric for choosing the number of communities into which a network should be divided. We demonstrate that our algorithms are highly effective at discovering community structure in both computer-generated and real-world network data, and show how they can be used to shed light on the sometimes dauntingly complex structure of networked systems.},

In this systematic review, we summarize the methods and uses of HSI/MSI for staining and color correction, immunohistochemistry, autofluorescence, and histopathological diagnostic research. Studies include hematology, breast cancer, head and neck cancer, skin cancer, and diseases of central nervous, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary systems. The use of HSI/MSI suggest an improvement in the detection of diseases and clinical practice compared with traditional RGB analysis, and brings new opportunities in histological analysis of samples, such as digital staining or alleviating the inter-laboratory variability of digitized samples. Nevertheless, the number of studies in this field is currently limited, and more research is needed to confirm the advantages of this technology compared to conventional imagery.},

In particular, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are gaining more and more attention in this field. CNNs have proved to be very effective in areas such as image recognition and classification, especially for the classification of large sets composed by two-dimensional images. However, their application to multispectral and hyperspectral images faces some challenges, especially related to the processing of the high-dimensional information contained in multidimensional data cubes. This results in a significant increase in computation time. In this paper, we present a new CNN architecture for the classification of hyperspectral images. The proposed CNN is a 3-D network that uses both spectral and spatial information. It also implements a border mirroring strategy to effectively process border areas in the image, and has been efficiently implemented using graphics processing units (GPUs). Our experimental results indicate that the proposed network performs accurately and efficiently, achieving a reduction of the computation time and increasing the accuracy in the classification of hyperspectral images when compared to other traditional ANN techniques.},

Clustering is one of the most used unsupervised techniques for the analysis of these scenes. Popular clustering techniques such as K-means are computationally expensive, particularly when applied to hyperspectral images characterized by their large dimensionality. An efficient implementation of K-means is the so-called Yinyang K-means, which outperforms K-means algorithms by clustering the centers in the initial stage, and leveraging efficiently maintained lower and upper bounds between each point and the cluster centers. In this work, we have adapted an efficient implementation of this algorithm using graphics processing units (GPUs) for hyperspectral image analysis. We have carried out a comparison of this technique with other existing implementations with the aim of demonstrating its usefulness in hyperspectral imaging.

Due to a relatively low spatial resolution of hyperspectral imaging, each image pixel may contain spectra from multiple materials. In turn, hyperspectral unmixing is finding these materials and their abundances. A few main approaches to performing hyperspectral unmixing have emerged, such as nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), linear mixture modelling (LMM), and, most recently, autoencoder networks. These methods use different approaches in finding the endmember and abundance of information from hyperspectral images. However, due to the huge variation of hyperspectral data being used, it is difficult to determine which methods perform sufficiently on which datasets and if they can generalize on any input data to solve hyperspectral unmixing problems. By trying to mitigate this problem, we propose a hyperspectral unmixing algorithm testing methodology and create a standard benchmark to test already available and newly created algorithms. A few different experiments were created, and a variety of hyperspectral datasets in this benchmark were used to compare openly available algorithms and to determine the best-performing ones.},

In this paper, we provide a seminal view on recent advances in techniques for hyperspectral image processing. Our main focus is on the design of techniques able to deal with the highdimensional nature of the data, and to integrate the spatial and spectral information. Performance of the discussed techniques is evaluated in different analysis scenarios. To satisfy time-critical constraints in specific applications, we also develop efficient parallel implementations of some of the discussed algorithms. Combined, these parts provide an excellent snapshot of the state-of-the-art in those areas, and offer a thoughtful perspective on future potentials and emerging challenges in the design of robust hyperspectral imaging algorithms.},

Among the different brain imaging techniques used to operate BCIs, electroencephalography (EEG) constitutes the preferred method of choice, owing to its relative low cost, ease of use, high temporal resolution, and noninvasiveness. In recent years, significant progress in wearable technologies and computational intelligence has greatly enhanced the performance and capabilities of EEG-based BCIs (eBCIs) and propelled their migration out of the laboratory and into real-world environments. This rapid translation constitutes a paradigm shift in human–machine interaction that will deeply transform different industries in the near future, including healthcare and wellbeing, entertainment, security, education, and marketing. In this contribution, the state-of-the-art in wearable biosensing is reviewed, focusing on the development of novel electrode interfaces for long term and noninvasive EEG monitoring. Commercially available EEG platforms are surveyed, and a comparative analysis is presented based on the benefits and limitations they provide for eBCI development. Emerging applications in neuroscientific research and future trends related to the widespread implementation of eBCIs for medical and nonmedical uses are discussed. Finally, a commentary on the ethical, social, and legal concerns associated with this increasingly ubiquitous technology is provided, as well as general recommendations to address key issues related to mainstream consumer adoption.},

This was attained by selecting the pixels of the region of interest (ROI), using a pre-calculated threshold value of the PCA scores arranged as histograms, to select the spectra set; summing up the selected spectra to achieve representativeness; and compensating for the superimposed filter paper spectral information, also supported by scores histograms for each individual sample. The best classification model was achieved using linear discriminant analysis and genetic algorithm (LDA/GA), whose correct classification rate in the external validation set was 92\%. Previous classification of the type of additive present in the gasoline is necessary to define the PLS model required for its quantitative determination. Considering that two of the additives studied present high spectral similarity, a PLS regression model was constructed to predict their content in gasoline, while two additional models were used for the remaining additives. The results for the external validation of these regression models showed a mean percentage error of prediction varying from 5 to 15\%.},

  abstract = {A multi-stage hierarchical clustering technique, which is an unsupervised technique, has been proposed in this paper for classifying the hyperspectral data.. The multistage algorithm consists of two stages. The “local” segmentor of the first stage performs region-growing segmentation by employing the hierarchical clustering procedure of CN-chain with the restriction that pixels in a cluster must be spatially contiguous. The “global” segmentor of the second stage, which has not spatial constraints for merging, clusters the segments resulting from the previous stage, using a contextfree similarity measure. This study applied the multistage hierarchical clustering method to the data generated by band reduction, band selection and data compression. The classification results were compared with them using full bands.},

  abstract = {This paper focuses on unsupervised clustering of hyperspectral pixels whose intensity may not be available across certain spectral bands. The presence of statistical correlations among pixels that contain data originating from the same material is exploited here to develop a novel regularized correlation analysis framework to perform clustering. Kernel learning is integrated in a regularized correlations framework to exploit nonlinear dependencies of pixels acquiring information about similar materials. An effective technique is proposed to select the kernel mapping parameters and form pertinent kernel covariance matrices by proper weighted-averaging that takes into account the information content across the available spectral bands. The novel correlations framework will return proper sparse clustering matrices whose nonzero entries point to the correlated pixels. These matrices will be obtained via a minimization formulation that will be solved via computationally efficient subgradient descent iterations. The novel correlations formulation is applied in small-size pixel patches of the original hyperspectral image, while recursively bigger size patches are built that contain information about the same materials. Extensive numerical tests on real hyperspectral images reveal that the proposed approach, in spite of being unsupervised, can outperform existing supervised and unsupervised techniques especially in the presence of missing pixels.},

However, most of these methods fail to reflect the data structure of HSI, leading to inconsistent results of band selection. To tackle this particular issue, we have proposed a novel hyperbolic clustering-based band hierarchy (HCBH) to fully represent the underlying spectral structure and obtain a more consistent band selection. With the proposed adaptive hyperbolic clustering, the performance can be effectively improved with the aid of geometrical information. By introducing a clustercentre based ranking metric, the desired band subset can be naturally obtained during the clustering process. Experimental results on three popularly used datasets have validated the superior performance of the proposed approach, which outperforms a few state-of-the-art (SOTA) UBS approaches.},

  abstract = {Community detection is often used to understand the structure of large and complex networks. One of the most popular algorithms for uncovering community structure is the so-called Louvain algorithm. We show that this algorithm has a major defect that largely went unnoticed until now: the Louvain algorithm may yield arbitrarily badly connected communities. In the worst case, communities may even be disconnected, especially when running the algorithm iteratively. In our experimental analysis, we observe that up to 25\% of the communities are badly connected and up to 16\% are disconnected. To address this problem, we introduce the Leiden algorithm. We prove that the Leiden algorithm yields communities that are guaranteed to be connected. In addition, we prove that, when the Leiden algorithm is applied iteratively, it converges to a partition in which all subsets of all communities are locally optimally assigned. Furthermore, by relying on a fast local move approach, the Leiden algorithm runs faster than the Louvain algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the Leiden algorithm for several benchmark and real-world networks. We find that the Leiden algorithm is faster than the Louvain algorithm and uncovers better partitions, in addition to providing explicit guarantees.},

Deep learning techniques have boosted the performance of hyperspectral image analysis. Compared with traditional machine learning, deep learning architectures exploit both spatial and spectral information of hyperspectral image analysis. To scrutinize thoroughly the current efforts, provide insights, and identify potential research directions on deep learning for hyperspectral image analysis in agriculture, this paper presents a systematic and comprehensive review. Firstly, its applications in agriculture are summarized, include ripeness and component prediction, different classification themes, and plant disease detection. Then, the recent achievements are reviewed in hyperspectral image analysis from the aspects of the deep learning models and the feature networks. Finally, the existing challenges of hyperspectral image analysis based on deep learning are summarized and the prospects of future works are put forward.},

  abstract = {The deep learning-based method has shown promising competence in image classification. Its success can be attributed to the ability to learn discriminative feature representation given plenty of labeled data. However, in real-hyperspectral image (HSI) classification applications, since pixel labeling is difficult and costly, the labels we can obtain within an HSI are always limited and noisy (i.e., inaccurate), which consequently causes overfitting of the deep learning-based method. To address this problem, we propose a novel unified deep learning network to employ both labeled and unlabeled data for training, with which the unsupervised structure knowledge, e.g., intracluster similarity and intercluster dissimilarity, inherently contained in those unlabeled data can be exploited to boost the conventional supervised classification. Specifically, we first explore the unsupervised structure knowledge in unlabeled data via a clustering method and formulate a supervised clustering task on those data with the obtained cluster labels. Then, we propose a multitask network to jointly address both the conventional classification task and the formulated supervised clustering task. With a shared feature extraction module and a high-level feature fusion module, the unsupervised structure knowledge contained in unlabeled data can be effectively introduced into the classification task, which is beneficial to learn a more discriminative feature representation and, thus, well mitigates the overfitting problem and improves the classification results. Experimental results on three data sets demonstrate the proposed method can effectively label the unlabeled data within an HSI, especially when the training labels are limited and noisy.},

According to the fast density peak-based clustering algorithm, we propose an unsupervised HSI clustering method based on the density of pixels in the spectral space and the distance between pixels. For the metric of the density, we present an adaptivebandwidth probability density function using pixel numbers as the input and the calculated pixel local density as the output, which determines the bandwidth on the basis of the Gaussian assumption. For the metric of the distance, in order to obtain a pixel-level spectral distance, we calculate the Euclidean distance between pixel vectors from the multiple bands. In the proposed approach: 1) use the least-squares method for the curve fitting of the two results; 2) eliminate outliers based on the Pauta criterion; 3) adopt regression calculation; and 4) obtain the cluster centers according to the classification criteria of the local density and the distance between pixel vectors. The other noncluster center points are clustered based on their similarities with the cluster centers by iteration. Finally, we compare the results with those of other unsupervised clustering methods and the reference data sets.},

  abstract = {Deep learning has achieved great successes in conventional computer vision tasks. In this paper, we exploit deep learning techniques to address the hyperspectral image classification problem. In contrast to conventional computer vision tasks that only examine the spatial context, our proposed method can exploit both spatial context and spectral correlation to enhance hyperspectral image classification. In particular, we advocate four new deep learning models, namely, 2-D convolutional neural network (2-D-CNN), 3-D-CNN, recurrent 2-D CNN (R-2-D-CNN), and recurrent 3-D-CNN (R-3-D-CNN) for hyperspectral image classification. We conducted rigorous experiments based on six publicly available data sets. Through a comparative evaluation with other state-of-the-art methods, our experimental results confirm the superiority of the proposed deep learning models, especially the R-3-D-CNN and the R-2-D-CNN deep learning models.},

Given a discrete clustering formulation, we first solve a relaxed continuous optimization problem by eigendecomposition. We clarify the role of eigenvectors as a generator of all optimal solutions through orthonormal transforms. We then solve an optimal discretization problem, which seeks a discrete solution closest to the continuous optima. The discretization is efficiently computed in an iterative fashion using singular value decomposition and nonmaximum suppression. The resulting discrete solutions are nearly global-optimal. Our method is robust to random initialization and converges faster than other clustering methods. Experiments on real image segmentation are reported.},

Many clustering-based band selection approaches have been proposed to deal with such a problem. However, a few of them consider the spectral and spatial relationship simultaneously. In this letter, we proposed a novel clustering-based band selection approach using deep subspace clustering (DSC). The proposed approach combines the subspace clustering task into a convolutional autoencoder by treating it as a self-expressive layer, enabling it to be trained end to end. The resulting network can fully extract the interaction of spectral bands based on using spatial information and nonlinear feature transformation. We compared the results of the proposed method with existing band selection methods for three widely used HSI data sets, showing that the proposed method is able to accurately select an informative band subset with remarkable classification accuracy.},

The proposed method is efficient, with quasilinear scaling in the number of data points, and enjoys robust theoretical performance guarantees. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real HSI data demonstrate its strong performance compared to benchmark and state-of-the-art methods. Indeed, the proposed method not only achieves excellent labeling accuracy, but also efficiently estimates the number of clusters.

In the past years, a growing number of advanced hyperspectral remote sensing image classification techniques based on manifold learning, sparse representation and deep learning have been proposed and reported a good performance in accuracy and efficiency on state-of-the-art public datasets. However, most existing methods still face challenges in dealing with large-scale hyperspectral image datasets due to their high computational complexity. In this work, we propose an improved spectral clustering method for large-scale hyperspectral image classification without any prior information. The proposed algorithm introduces two efficient approximation techniques based on Nyström extension and anchor-based graph to construct the affinity matrix. We also propose an effective solution to solve the eigenvalue decomposition problem by multiplicative update optimization. Experiments on both the synthetic datasets and the hyperspectral image datasets were conducted to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

In recent years, there has been an emergence of deep learning algorithms being applied to hyperspectral and multispectral imagery for remote sensing and biomedicine tasks. These multichannel images come with their own unique set of challenges that must be addressed for effective image analysis. Challenges include limited ground truth (annotation is expensive and extensive labeling is often not feasible), and high dimensional nature of the data (each pixel is represented by hundreds of spectral bands), despite being presented by a large amount of unlabeled data and the potential to leverage multiple sensors/sources that observe the same scene. In this chapter, we will review recent advances in the community that leverage deep learning for robust hyperspectral image analysis despite these unique challenges – specifically, we will review unsupervised, semi-supervised and active learning approaches to image analysis, as well as transfer learning approaches for multi-source (e.g. multi-sensor, or multi-temporal) image analysis.},
